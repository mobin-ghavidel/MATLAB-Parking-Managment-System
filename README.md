Parking Management System - A Smart Parking Assistant

The Parking Management System is an interactive and user-friendly MATLAB-based application that streamlines the process of finding and reserving parking spots. Designed with efficiency in mind, the system reads data from parking spot availability, vehicle details, and pricing information to help users select the most suitable parking space.

Key Features:

    Dynamic Spot Selection: Users can specify their vehicle size and receive tailored parking options.
    Preference-Based Filtering: Choose a spot based on affordability, security (CCTV monitoring), or cleanliness (covered spaces).
    Smart Recommendations: The system can suggest the best option based on availability and user preferences.
    Interactive UI: Uses pop-up menus and UI elements for a smooth and intuitive experience.
    Automated Status Updates: Once a spot is selected, the system updates the parking database to reflect availability.

This project ensures convenience, efficiency, and customization for an optimal parking experience. 🚗🅿️
